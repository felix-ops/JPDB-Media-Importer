## Features
- Seamless integration of **images, audio, and sentence media** from Anki into JPDB.
- Automatic filtering and categorizing of media **based on the vocabulary present in the sentence**.
- With this extension, media is automatically injected into **JPDB vocabulary and review pages**.

## Requirements
To start using this extension, make sure you have the following:

1. **JPDB API Key** (Required for interacting with JPDB)
2. **Anki** (Installed on your computer)
3. **Anki Connect Addon** (Installed in Anki)
4. **Anki Deck** (Containing the media files you want to integrate with JPDB)
5. **Chrome Browser** (any browser which supports Chrome extensions)

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Install Anki & Anki Connect
- Download and install **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**.
- Install the **[Anki Connect Addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)** from AnkiWeb.
- create the deck 

### 2. Configure the Extension
- Enter your **JPDB API Key** (which is crucial for categorizing media base on VID).
- Set the **Anki Connect URL** (default: `http://localhost:8765`).
- Choose the **Anki Deck** which contains the cards to fetch media from.
- In the **Context Field** choose the field that contains the sentences. (It can contain both the Japanese and Translated sentences together, the extension will handle the separation) 
- Enable/disable **Auto Play Audio** and **Hide Native Sentence** as needed.
- Hit **Sync Data with Anki** to fetch all the data from the anki cards
- Click **Save Config** to store your settings.

## How It Works
1. The extension fetches vocabulary from the **JPDB page** the user is currently on.
2. It then checks **Anki** (via Anki Connect) to see if there are any media files associated with that vocabulary.
3. If media files exist, they are **automatically injected** into JPDBâ€™s **Vocabulary** and **Review** pages.

## Troubleshooting
### 1. Media is not appearing on JPDB
- Ensure that **Anki is running** in the background.
- Check if **Anki Connect is installed** and responding at `http://localhost:8765`.
- Verify that the **deck and field names** in the extension match those in Anki.
- Make sure that the **each card's context field has some valid vocabulary text**.
